# WitherBlight
Quick Overview:
- Wither Blight is a 3rd-person Rogue-Lite that is heavily influenced by the movement and combat mechanics seen in Boomer Shooters.
- In-run upgrades will come in two different ways: either experience-based upgrades or finding items scattered around the level. However, the player will not be able to select upgrades or get items until a level is complete. This aims to reduce interruptions in gameplay and aid in making builds.
- The ammo system will be integrated into the level. Ammo can be obtained either by passively gathering it in the world or by destroying environmental blocks.
- The art style is going to be low-poly, where everything is going to be made up of simple shapes (squares and triangles). Fractule Computer Bismuth is what I have unofficially called this style.

 Code:
 This project was created from the 3rd-person Unreal example project.
